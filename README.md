# BSU Machine Learning Lectures

This repository contains example notebooks from a machine learning course at Belarusian State University. The examples cover a recommendation system and a simple stock price forecasting workflow.

## Contents

- **Recommendation System** – demonstrates building an item-based recommender using Last.fm listening data. The `archive` folder contains two CSV files with artist IDs and user scrobbles used in the notebook `Recommendation_BSU.ipynb`.
- **Stock Forecast** – shows a time series forecasting approach for stock prices using the notebook `BSE_TimeSeries_stock_forecasting.ipynb` and a sample dataset `data_example.xlsx`.

## Lecture Video

A recorded lesson is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY7Kh658Bvk). The video is presented in Russian.

## Usage

Open the notebooks in Jupyter or an equivalent environment with Python 3. Required packages include `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`. The data files are stored within the repository so you can run the code as-is.

Feel free to experiment with the notebooks or adapt the examples for your own learning.
