# ðŸ“˜ BSU Machine Learning Lectures

This repository contains two applied machine learning notebooks developed for students at Belarusian State University (BSU). The focus is on solving **real-world problems** with as little theory as possible â€” using real data and production-ready tools.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ”¹ Recommendation System
Notebook: `Recommendation_BSU.ipynb`  
- Item-based recommender system using Last.fm listening data  
- Simple, interpretable metrics for quality: Hit Rate, MAP, NDCG  
- Data in `archive/`:
  - `lastfm_user_scrobbles.csv`
  - `lastfm_artist_list.csv`

### ðŸ”¹ Stock Forecasting
Notebook: `BSE_TimeSeries_stock_forecasting.ipynb`  
- Time series forecasting based on real stock data  
- Concepts: rate-based differencing, stationarity checks, trend modeling  
- Dataset: `data_example.xlsx`

## Usage

1. Open notebooks in JupyterLab, VSCode, or any Python 3.x environment
2. Required packages (install with `pip`):
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `statsmodels`
   - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for plotting)
3. All datasets are included â€” no need for database connections

## Evaluation Metrics in Recommenders

Offline metrics like:
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** â€” how many top items are relevant
- **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)** â€” takes item position into account
- **Hit Rate** â€” measures if the relevant item was recommended

>  However, real validation of recommender systems should be done via **A/B testing** â€” offline metrics alone can be misleading in production.
